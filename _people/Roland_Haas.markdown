##### Biography

I am currently a research programmer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I provide support for users of NCSA's supercomputers and help develop the Einstein Toolkit astrophysics simulation framework. My SpEC related work is on studying binary neutron star mergers as well as other computing related projects.

I obtained my PhD from the University of Guelph, Canada working with Eric Poisson on black hole
pertubation theory and self-force problems. I later joined the numerical relativity group at
GeorgiaTech and afterwards TAPIR as a postdoc before moving to the AEI, and finally to NCSA.
